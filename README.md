The <b>Learning Management System (LAMS)</b> is an open source Learning Design system for designing, managing and delivering online collaborative learning activities. It provides teachers with an intuitive visual authoring environment for creating sequences of learning activities. These activities can include a range of individual tasks, small group work and whole class activities based on both content and collaboration.

LAMS is written in Java, Javascript and uses an MySQL database for data storage.
